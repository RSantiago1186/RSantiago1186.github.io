## Explanation
Built an application similar to Spotify in order to gain knowledge through the HTML/CSS and using the DOM/JQuery.

## Problem
Creating a website from scratch can sometimes be daunting. But in this case it is something meant to enforce and improve my skills with general web development tools.

## Solution
Use various languages to create something similar to Spotify.

## Results
The site seems to be great as it has a front page with a few different links to other parts of the page. Among these pages is a media player which seems to work great and can be easily accessed through its quick access media controller or through the specific song's content box.

## Conclusion
This was a great excercise to test my knowledge and spread my wings a bit. It all happened so quick yet served its purpose. Now next time perhaps I will be able to make a full pledged working website revolving this platform!
