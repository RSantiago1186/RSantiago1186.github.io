title: Studying Web development has its challenges!
--
So when thought about joining bloc was about a year ago to today 2/01/2017 and didn't start as I was unsure of how I wanted to approach web development along with the host cost of schooling even though a relatively "small" cost for a short time just seemed like a no brainer. I didn't go through with it until November 7th, 2016 though as the whole time between then I was trying to learn on my own and look into what I could do with the little experience I had or also about other schools that were offering similar programs. Being in the "Bay area" with a fulltime job and "at the time" 2 months along the way old baby I decided something had to be done as I needed a lifestyle change with money not being viable in the San Jose area for what I would like as far as bringing a child into this world would require. Anyways I inquired about Bloc and started to pursue it and eventually enrolled into it at which my start date was Nov 7. It was a great time as I was just off a diet bet with some friends, after blizzcon, and before my birthday so it seemed like a great time even with pending holidays to jump in as I would have some free time. It is now 02/02/2017 and a quarter of the way through the program and it has its ups and downs. I will continue more in detail on my next blog!
