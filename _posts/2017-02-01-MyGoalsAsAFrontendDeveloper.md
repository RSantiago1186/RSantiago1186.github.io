title: My goals as a Frontend developer!
--
Currently as a frontend developer I would like to learn all the languages... But we all know that is not possible! So currently I am working with angular and getting along with it as with the DOM we just were not getting along at all haha! But with angular it seems to be a start, as it did with JQuery although our relationship ended rather quick. Anyways, as my goal as a frontend developer is to land a career somewhere as I am tired of moving from job to job and would love to stay somewhere consistant. If I had a dream job though I would say it would be somewhere withing the e-commerce or gaming verticals. I have a great passion for both and it would be great to be within those, if not just being in the development field would jumpstart everything for me as its something I love to do.
