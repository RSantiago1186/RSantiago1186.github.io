title: Biggest challenge I have faced as a developer thus far!
--
My biggest challenge thus far to date would have to be Basic Javascript (DOM). To me it is incredibly hard due to all the different syntax you have to remember to make something work as everything requires something different and is really LONG in terms of its syntax. Coding a loop in general can take quiet a few lines but if you did it in a different language or framework it could take just 1-3 lines instead of 10 or so! But anyways as far as a developer goes I believe the hardest part is just staying at the task at hand as you may get discouraged sometimes but the key is to remember "If it was easy, everyone would be a developer".
